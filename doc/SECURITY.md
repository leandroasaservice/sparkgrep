# Security Policy

## 🛡️ Security Overview

SparkGrep is committed to maintaining the highest security standards. This document outlines our security policies, procedures, and how to report vulnerabilities.

## 🔒 Security Measures

### Automated Security Scanning

| Tool | Purpose | Frequency | Scope |
|------|---------|-----------|-------|
| **Bandit** | Static code analysis | Every commit + Daily | Python source code |
| **Safety** | Dependency vulnerabilities | Every commit + Daily | Python packages |
| **GitGuardian** | Secret detection | Every commit + Daily | All files |
| **SonarCloud** | Security hotspots | Every commit | Code quality & security |

### Security Requirements

#### For Pull Requests
- ✅ **No critical or high vulnerabilities** allowed
- ✅ **Admin approval** required for all PRs to main
- ✅ **Security scans** must pass before merge
- ✅ **Code review** by security-aware maintainers

#### For Dependencies
- ✅ **Vulnerability scanning** on every change
- ✅ **Automated alerts** for new vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Regular updates** of dependencies
- ✅ **Minimal dependency** principle followed

#### For Secrets Management
- ✅ **No hardcoded secrets** in code
- ✅ **GitHub Secrets** for sensitive data
- ✅ **Secret rotation** procedures in place
- ✅ **Access logging** for secret usage

## 🚨 Reporting Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

1. **For non-critical issues**: Use our [Security Issue Template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/security_report.md)
2. **For critical issues**: Contact maintainers directly at `security@[domain]`
3. **For responsible disclosure**: Follow our disclosure timeline below

### Vulnerability Severity Levels

| Level | Response Time | Description |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Critical** | < 24 hours | Immediate threat, system compromise possible |
| **High** | < 48 hours | Significant security risk, data exposure possible |
| **Medium** | < 1 week | Moderate risk, limited impact |
| **Low** | < 1 month | Minor security concerns |

### Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1**: Acknowledgment sent to reporter
3. **Day 7**: Initial assessment completed
4. **Day 30**: Fix developed and tested
5. **Day 45**: Fix deployed and public disclosure

## 🔍 Security Monitoring

### Continuous Monitoring

- **Daily security scans** at 6 AM UTC
- **Real-time vulnerability alerts** via GitHub
- **Automated issue creation** for new threats
- **Security metrics tracking** in SonarCloud

### Security Metrics

We track and maintain:

- **Zero tolerance** for critical vulnerabilities
- **< 24 hour** resolution time for high-severity issues
- **100% security scan coverage** of codebase
- **Regular security training** for contributors

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets** (API keys, passwords, tokens)
2. **Use secure coding practices** (input validation, output encoding)
3. **Follow principle of least privilege**
4. **Keep dependencies updated** and minimal
5. **Write security tests** for security-critical features

### For Users

1. **Keep SparkGrep updated** to latest version
2. **Verify checksums** for downloaded packages
3. **Use virtual environments** for isolation
4. **Report suspicious behavior** immediately
5. **Follow secure deployment practices**

## 🔧 Security Configuration

### Required Security Tools

```bash
# Install security scanning tools
pip install bandit[toml] safety gitguardian

# Run local security checks
bandit -r src/
safety check
ggshield secret scan ci
```

### Security Settings

#### GitHub Repository Settings

```yaml
Security:
  ✅ Dependency alerts enabled
  ✅ Security advisories enabled
  ✅ Token scanning enabled
  ✅ Secret scanning enabled
  ✅ Private vulnerability reporting enabled

Branch Protection (main):
  ✅ Require pull request reviews
  ✅ Require status checks
  ✅ Require conversation resolution
  ✅ Restrict pushes that create files
  ✅ Require linear history
```

#### SonarCloud Quality Gate

```yaml
Security:
  ✅ Security Rating: A
  ✅ Vulnerabilities: 0
  ✅ Security Hotspots: 0
  ✅ Coverage: ≥ 80%
```
